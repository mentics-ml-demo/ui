# ui

Web UI to interact with and view realtime status of the system.

## Developing

`bun install` to install packages
`bun dev` to run dev server

## Building

Solid apps are built with _presets_, which optimise your project for deployment to different environments.

By default, `npm run build` will generate a Node app that you can run with `npm start`. To use a different preset, add it to the `devDependencies` in `package.json` and specify in your `app.config.js`.
